## üìú Program Overview

Welcome to the **Faculty Undergraduate Research Program (FURP)** at Dr Cui's group. This program is designed to provide undergraduate students with an opportunity to engage in real-world research, apply what they've learned in the classroom, and build valuable academic skills. FURP is a dynamic, hands-on experience where you can explore research areas, work on real projects, and, for eligible students, earn a certificate upon successful completion.

### ‚û§ **Participation Tiers**
The program has three main participation categories, each with different levels of access and outcomes:

| Role              | Privileges                                          | Certificate Eligibility |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **First-time Participant**    | Full research access and mentorship | ‚úÖ Eligible after completing the program  |  
| **Continuing Participant**    | Leadership roles and mentorship opportunities | ‚úÖ Eligible after completing the program |
| **Volunteer**     | Hands-on research experience only  | ‚ùå Not eligible for certification in this round  |

- **First-time participants** and **continuing participants** are eligible for certificates after fulfilling program requirements.
- **Volunteers** can continue to participate in future rounds of FURP to earn their certificate, but they will not receive certification in the current round.

### ‚û§ **Core Objectives of FURP**
The program is designed to help you achieve the following goals:

## üßëüíª **GitHub Workflow**

At FURP, we follow an **Agile project management** system, leveraging GitHub for repository management and task tracking. Here‚Äôs how you should manage your project:

### **1. Repository Setup**
- **Create a Repository** with the format: `[FURP-2025]/YourName-ProjectTag`  
  Example: `furp-2025/Jason-ROSBootcamp`

- **Mandatory Folder Structure:**
    ```
    /docs
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 00_weekly.md
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ meeting_notes/
    /src
    FURP_Showcase.pdf
    ```

- **Weekly Progress Updates:**  
  Every week, you must update the `00_weekly.md` file with progress reports, challenges faced, and next steps.

- **Meeting Notes:**  
  Record the key takeaways from all team meetings in the `meeting_notes/` folder.

- **Showcase Presentation:**  
  As part of the program, you will create a poster or a PDF to present your research at the FURP Showcase event. This file should be placed in the root directory of your repository (`FURP_Showcase.pdf`).

### **2. Project Updates**
- Regularly update your progress in the repository. Your team will use these updates to track progress and identify any issues.
  
- **Weekly Meetings:**  
  FURP will schedule weekly meetings to review your progress. These meetings may be either online or in person. Make sure to actively participate and provide updates.

### **3. Project Transfers**
If you wish to switch tracks during the program (e.g., from Bootcamp to Research or vice versa), please email the project lead with the subject ‚ÄúProject Transfer Request‚Äù and CC your supervising faculty member.
